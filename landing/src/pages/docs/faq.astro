        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <h2>General</h2>

        <h3>What is gsheetbase?</h3>
        <p>
            gsheetbase is a service that turns your Google Sheets into a
            powerful database. Use standard SQL-like queries to read, write, and
            update data directly from your spreadsheets.
        </p>

        <h3>Is gsheetbase free?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes! gsheetbase has a free tier with up to 1,000 requests per month.
            We also offer paid plans for higher usage.
        </p>

        <h3>What spreadsheets does gsheetbase work with?</h3>
        <p>
            gsheetbase works with Google Sheets. Just share your spreadsheet
            with the gsheetbase service account, and you're ready to go.
        </p>

        <h2>Usage & Integration</h2>

        <h3>How do I authenticate?</h3>
        <p>Use your API key when initializing the client:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">{`const db = new gsheetbase({ apiKey: 'your-key' });`}</code></pre>

        <h3>Can I use gsheetbase with Node.js?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes, gsheetbase has SDKs for Node.js, Python, and JavaScript
            (browser). Check the documentation for your language.
        </p>

        <h3>What are the rate limits?</h3>
        <p>
            Free tier: 1,000 requests/month. Pro tier: 100,000 requests/month.
            Enterprise: Custom limits. Each request counts as one query
            operation.
        </p>

        <h2>Data & Performance</h2>

        <h3>How fast is gsheetbase?</h3>
        <p>
            Most queries complete in under 100ms. Performance depends on
            spreadsheet size and query complexity. Larger datasets may take
            longer.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I query large spreadsheets?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes, gsheetbase can handle spreadsheets with tens of thousands of
            rows. For very large datasets, we recommend using filters and limits
            to improve performance.
        </p>

        <h3>Is my data secure?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes. All data is encrypted in transit using HTTPS. We use OAuth 2.0
            for authentication and never store your spreadsheet contents on our
            servers.
        </p>

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

        <h3>I'm getting an authentication error</h3>
        <p>
            Make sure you've shared your spreadsheet with the gsheetbase service
            account. Check your API key is correct and hasn't expired.
        </p>

        <h3>Queries are slow</h3>
        <p>
            Try adding filters with <code>where()</code> clauses and limits. Large
            spreadsheets benefit from narrowing down results.
        </p>
