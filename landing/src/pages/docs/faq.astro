        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <!-- ─── General ─── -->
        <h2>General</h2>

        <h3>What is Gsheetbase?</h3>
        <p>
            Gsheetbase is a SaaS platform that turns any Google Sheet into a
            live REST API. Sign in with Google, register a spreadsheet, publish
            it, and immediately start reading or writing rows over HTTP — no
            server or code required.
        </p>

        <h3>Does Gsheetbase access all my Google Drive files?</h3>
        <p>
            No. Gsheetbase uses OAuth 2.0 with the minimal
            <code>spreadsheets.readonly</code> scope by default. You explicitly choose
            which spreadsheet to connect — Gsheetbase cannot see or access any other
            files on your Drive.
        </p>

        <h3>Does Gsheetbase copy or store my spreadsheet data?</h3>
        <p>
            No. Gsheetbase stores only the <em>reference</em> to your spreadsheet
            (the Spreadsheet ID) and your OAuth tokens. Every API request fetches
            the latest data live from Google Sheets.
        </p>

        <h3>Is there a free plan?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes. Gsheetbase offers a free tier so you can get started without a
            credit card. Paid plans are available for higher request volumes and
            additional features. Check the
            <a href="/#pricing">pricing page</a> for current limits.
        </p>

        <!-- ─── Authentication & Access ─── -->
        <h2>Authentication &amp; Access</h2>

        <h3>How does authentication work for public API endpoints?</h3>
        <p>
            Gsheetbase supports three methods — choose one per sheet from the
            dashboard's <strong>Auth Settings</strong>:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>API key in URL path</strong> (default) —
                <code>GET /v1/gsb_live_xxx</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bearer token</strong> —
                <code>Authorization: Bearer &lt;token&gt;</code>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Basic auth</strong> —
                <code>Authorization: Basic &lt;base64(user:pass)&gt;</code>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How do I regenerate or rotate my API key?</h3>
        <p>
            Open the sheet in the Gsheetbase dashboard, go to <strong
                >Auth Settings → Rotate Key</strong
            >. The old key is immediately revoked and a new one is issued.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I make a sheet private (require authentication)?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes. Switch the auth type to <strong>Bearer token</strong> or
            <strong>Basic auth</strong> in the dashboard. Requests without valid credentials
            will receive a <code>401 Unauthorized</code> response.
        </p>

        <!-- ─── Writing Data ─── -->
        <h2>Writing Data</h2>

        <h3>Can I write data back to my sheet?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes. By default a published sheet is read-only. In the dashboard
            open <strong>Write Settings</strong> and enable the HTTP methods you need
            (<code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>PATCH</code>,
            <code>DELETE</code>). Gsheetbase will ask you to grant write
            permission to your Google account the first time.
        </p>

        <h3>What does POST vs PUT vs PATCH do?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>POST</strong> — appends a new row.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>PUT</strong> — replaces all columns in matched rows.
            </li>
            <li><strong>PATCH</strong> — updates only the provided fields.</li>
            <li><strong>DELETE</strong> — removes matched rows.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- ─── Rate Limits & Performance ─── -->
        <h2>Rate Limits &amp; Performance</h2>

        <h3>What are the rate limits?</h3>
        <p>
            Rate limits and daily/monthly quotas depend on your plan. Exceeding
            a limit returns a <code>429 Too Many Requests</code> response. See the
            <a href="/#pricing">pricing page</a> for current numbers.
        </p>

        <h3>How fast are responses?</h3>
        <p>
            Response time depends on Google Sheets API latency and the size of
            your sheet. Typical requests complete in 200–600 ms. Use the
            <code>fields</code>, <code>where</code>, and <code>limit</code>
            query parameters to minimize the amount of data transferred.
        </p>

        <h3>Is there caching?</h3>
        <p>
            Gsheetbase can cache responses in Redis when available. This reduces
            latency for frequently accessed sheets, while writes automatically
            invalidate the relevant cache entries.
        </p>

        <!-- ─── Troubleshooting ─── -->
        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

        <h3>I get "sheet owner needs to reconnect Google account"</h3>
        <p>
            Your OAuth access token has expired or been revoked. Sign in to the
            Gsheetbase dashboard and click <strong
                >Reconnect Google Account</strong
            > to refresh your credentials.
        </p>

        <h3>I get "POST method not enabled for this sheet"</h3>
        <p>
            Write methods are disabled by default. Open the sheet in the
            dashboard, go to <strong>Write Settings</strong>, and toggle the
            methods you need.
        </p>

        <h3>My data has the wrong column names</h3>
        <p>
            Gsheetbase uses the <em>first row</em> of each sheet tab as headers. Make
            sure the first row contains your column names and that
            <strong>Use first row as header</strong> is enabled (it is by default
            at publish time).
        </p>
